==============================================
A demo of the Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm
==============================================

This example demonstrates how to generate a dataset and bicluster it
using the the Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm.

The dataset is generated using the ``make_biclusters`` function, which
creates a matrix of small values and implants bicluster with large
values. The rows and columns are then shuffled and passed to the
Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm. Rearranging the shuffled matrix to
make biclusters contiguous shows how accurately the algorithm found
the biclusters.

=================================
Gaussian Mixture Model Sine Curve
=================================

This example highlights the advantages of the Dirichlet Process:
complexity control and dealing with sparse data. The dataset is formed
by 100 points loosely spaced following a noisy sine curve. The fit by
the GMM class, using the expectation-maximization algorithm to fit a
mixture of 10 Gaussian components, finds too-small components and very
little structure. The fits by the Dirichlet process, however, show
that the model can either learn a global structure for the data (small
alpha) or easily interpolate to finding relevant local structure
(large alpha), never falling into the problems shown by the GMM class.

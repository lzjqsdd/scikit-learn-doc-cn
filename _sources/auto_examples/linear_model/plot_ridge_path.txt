===========================================================
Plot Ridge coefficients as a function of the regularization
===========================================================

Shows the effect of collinearity in the coefficients of an estimator.

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.linear_model

:class:`Ridge` Regression is the estimator used in this example.
Each color represents a different feature of the
coefficient vector, and this is displayed as a function of the
regularization parameter.

At the end of the path, as alpha tends toward zero
and the solution tends towards the ordinary least squares, coefficients
exhibit big oscillations.

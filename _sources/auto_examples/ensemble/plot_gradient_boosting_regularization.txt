Gradient Boosting regularization
================================

Illustration of the effect of different regularization strategies
for Gradient Boosting. The example is taken from Hastie et al 2009.

The loss function used is binomial deviance. Regularization via
shrinkage (``learning_rate < 1.0``) improves performance considerably.
In combination with shrinkage, stochastic gradient boosting
(``subsample < 1.0``) can produce more accurate models by reducing the
variance via bagging.
Subsampling without shrinkage usually does poorly.
Another strategy to reduce the variance is by subsampling the features
analogous to the random splits in Random Forests
(via the ``max_features`` parameter).

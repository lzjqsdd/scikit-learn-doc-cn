==================================================
Plot the decision boundaries of a VotingClassifier
==================================================

Plot the decision boundaries of a `VotingClassifier` for
two features of the Iris dataset.

Plot the class probabilities of the first sample in a toy dataset
predicted by three different classifiers and averaged by the
`VotingClassifier`.

First, three examplary classifiers are initialized (`DecisionTreeClassifier`,
`KNeighborsClassifier`, and `SVC`) and used to initialize a
soft-voting `VotingClassifier` with weights `[2, 1, 2]`, which means that
the predicted probabilities of the `DecisionTreeClassifier` and `SVC`
count 5 times as much as the weights of the `KNeighborsClassifier` classifier
when the averaged probability is calculated.
